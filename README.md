  For our first project, we have decided to collect video game data from a video game database and analyze how video games has changed over the last 15+ years. 
  
  We were curious to know if there were any trends in the production or rating of video games over time, and we also wanted to examine the top rated and bottom rated games from this database. Our data also provided us with the platforms that these games were offered on, which allows us to examine the game genres and overall success of games that are offered on specific platforms.
1. API
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Datetime

  We grabbed our data from the IGBD (Internet Game Database) API, using get requests, layed out all the data on DataFrames using pandas, and plotted the data using matplotlib and seaborn. We also imported datetime to change the release dates of the video games from epoch unix to human readable.
