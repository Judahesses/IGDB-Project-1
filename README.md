# IGDB-Project-1

For our project 1, we decided to grab video game data from a video game database and analyze how video games has changed over the last 10+ years. 

We grabbed our data from the IGBD (Internet Game Database) API, using get requests, layed out all the data on DataFrames using pandas, and plotted the data using matplotlib. 

We were curious to know if there were any trends in the terms of game genres and review ratings, offered on the three major video game platforms, as well as seeing how video games either got better or worse as the years went by.
